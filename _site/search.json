    "text": "PUBLISHED\nNovember 18, 2022\n\npackages = c('sf','tidyverse')\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to handle geospatial data in R by using sf package.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you should acquire the following competencies:\n\ninstalling and loading sf and tidyverse packages into R environment,\nimporting geospatial data by using appropriate functions of sf package,\nimporting aspatial data by using appropriate function of readr package,\nexploring the content of simple feature data frame by using appropriate Base R and sf functions,\nassigning or transforming coordinate systems by using using appropriate sf functions,\nconverting an aspatial data into a sf data frame by using appropriate function of sf package,\nperforming geoprocessing tasks by using appropriate functions of sf package,\nperforming data wrangling tasks by using appropriate functions of dplyr package and\nperforming Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by using appropriate functions from ggplot2 package.\n\n\nNote: Students are encouraged to read the reference guide of each function, especially the input data requirements, syntaxt and argument option before using them.\n\n\n\n\nData are key to data analytics including geospatial analytics. Hence, before analysing, we need to assemble the necessary data. In this hands-on exercise, you are required to extract the necessary data sets from the following sources:\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from data.gov.sg\nPre-Schools Location from data.gov.sg\nCycling Path from LTADataMall\nLatest version of Singapore Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb\n\n\nNote: The purpose of this section is not merely extracting the necessary data sets. It also aims to introduce you to public available data sets. Students are encouraged to explore the rest of the available data sets in these three data sources.\n\n\n\nNext, at the Hands-on_Ex01 folder, create a sub-folder called data. Then, inside the data sub-folder, create two sub-folders and name them geospatial and aspatial respectively.\nPlace Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web), Pre-Schools Location and Cycling Path zipped files into geospatial sub-folder and unzipped them. Copy the unzipped files from their respective sub-folders and place them inside geospatial sub-folder.\n\n\n\nNow, you will extract the downloaded listing data file. At Downloads folder, cut and paste listing.csv into aspatial sub-folder.\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, two R packages will be used. They are:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data, and\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\n\nTidyverse consists of a family of R packages. In this hands-on exercise, the following packages will be used:\n\nreadr for importing csv data,\nreadxl for importing Excel worksheet,\ntidyr for manipulating data,\ndplyr for transforming data, and\nggplot2 for visualising data\n\nType the following code chunk.\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)\n\nWhat we can learn from the code chunk above:\n\np_load function pf pacman package is used to install and load sf and tidyverse pacages into R environment.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to import the following geospatial data into R by using st_read() of sf package:\n\nMP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format,\nCyclingPath, a line feature layer in ESRI shapefile format, and\nPreSchool, a point feature layer in kml file format.\n\n\n\n\nmpsz = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", layer = \"MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL\")\n\nReading layer `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL' from data source \n  `D:\\yuetongz\\ISSS624\\data\\geospatial' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 323 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nThe message above reveals that the geospatial objects are multipolygon features. There are a total of 323 multipolygon features and 15 fields in mpsz simple feature data frame. mpsz is in svy21 projected coordinates systems. The bounding box provides the x extend and y extend of the data.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() function of sf package to import CyclingPath shapefile into R as line feature data frame.\n\ncyclingpath = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", layer = \"CyclingPath\")\n\nReading layer `CyclingPath' from data source `D:\\yuetongz\\ISSS624\\data\\geospatial' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1625 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 12711.19 ymin: 28711.33 xmax: 42626.09 ymax: 48948.15\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nThe message above reveals that there are a total of 1625 features and 2 fields in cyclingpath linestring feature data frame and it is in svy21 projected coordinates system too.\n\n\n\nThe pre-schools-location-kml is in kml format. The code chunk below will be used to import the kml into R. Notice that in the code chunk below, the complete path and the kml file extension were provided.\n\npreschool = st_read(\"data/geospatial/pre-schools-location-kml.kml\")\n\nReading layer `PRESCHOOLS_LOCATION' from data source \n  `D:\\yuetongz\\ISSS624\\data\\geospatial\\pre-schools-location-kml.kml' \n  using driver `KML'\nSimple feature collection with 1359 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 103.6824 ymin: 1.248403 xmax: 103.9897 ymax: 1.462134\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nThe message above reveals that preschool is a point feature data frame. There are a total of 1359 features and 2 fields. Different from the previous two simple feature data frame, preschool is in wgs84 coordinates system.\n\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn different ways to retrieve information related to the content of a simple feature data frame.\n\n\nThe column in the sf data.frame that contains the geometries is a list, of class sfc. We can retrieve the geometry list-column in this case by mpsz$geom or mpsz[[1]], but the more general way uses st_geometry() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nst_geometry(mpsz)\n\nGeometry set for 323 features \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\nFirst 5 geometries:\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((31495.56 30140.01, 31980.96 296...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((29092.28 30021.89, 29119.64 300...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((29932.33 29879.12, 29947.32 298...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((27131.28 30059.73, 27088.33 297...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((26451.03 30396.46, 26440.47 303...\n\n\nNotice that the print only displays basic information of the feature class such as type of geometry, the geographic extent of the features and the coordinate system of the data.\n\n\n\nBeside the basic feature information, we also would like to learn more about the associated attribute information in the data frame. This is the time you will find glimpse() of dplyr. very handy as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nglimpse(mpsz)\n\nRows: 323\nColumns: 16\n$ OBJECTID   <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, …\n$ SUBZONE_NO <int> 1, 1, 3, 8, 3, 7, 9, 2, 13, 7, 12, 6, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, …\n$ SUBZONE_N  <chr> \"MARINA SOUTH\", \"PEARL'S HILL\", \"BOAT QUAY\", \"HENDERSON HIL…\n$ SUBZONE_C  <chr> \"MSSZ01\", \"OTSZ01\", \"SRSZ03\", \"BMSZ08\", \"BMSZ03\", \"BMSZ07\",…\n$ CA_IND     <chr> \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"Y\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\",…\n$ PLN_AREA_N <chr> \"MARINA SOUTH\", \"OUTRAM\", \"SINGAPORE RIVER\", \"BUKIT MERAH\",…\n$ PLN_AREA_C <chr> \"MS\", \"OT\", \"SR\", \"BM\", \"BM\", \"BM\", \"BM\", \"SR\", \"QT\", \"QT\",…\n$ REGION_N   <chr> \"CENTRAL REGION\", \"CENTRAL REGION\", \"CENTRAL REGION\", \"CENT…\n$ REGION_C   <chr> \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\",…\n$ INC_CRC    <chr> \"5ED7EB253F99252E\", \"8C7149B9EB32EEFC\", \"C35FEFF02B13E0E5\",…\n$ FMEL_UPD_D <date> 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05…\n$ X_ADDR     <dbl> 31595.84, 28679.06, 29654.96, 26782.83, 26201.96, 25358.82,…\n$ Y_ADDR     <dbl> 29220.19, 29782.05, 29974.66, 29933.77, 30005.70, 29991.38,…\n$ SHAPE_Leng <dbl> 5267.381, 3506.107, 1740.926, 3313.625, 2825.594, 4428.913,…\n$ SHAPE_Area <dbl> 1630379.27, 559816.25, 160807.50, 595428.89, 387429.44, 103…\n$ geometry   <MULTIPOLYGON [m]> MULTIPOLYGON (((31495.56 30..., MULTIPOLYGON (…\n\n\nglimpse() report reveals the data type of each fields.

We are also interested to visualise the geospatial features. This is the time you will find plot() of R Graphic comes in very handy as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(mpsz)\n\nWarning: plotting the first 9 out of 15 attributes; use max.plot = 15 to plot\nall\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default plot of an sf object is a multi-plot of all attributes, up to a reasonable maximum as shown above. We can, however, choose to plot only the geometry by using the code chunk below.\n\nplot(st_geometry(mpsz))\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can also choose the plot the sf object by using a specific attribute as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(mpsz[\"PLN_AREA_N\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap projection is an important property of a geospatial data. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, we need to ensure that both geospatial data are projected using similar coordinate system.\nIn this section, you will learn how to project a simple feature data frame from one coordinate system to another coordinate system. The technical term of this process is called projection transformation.\n\n\nOne of the common issue that can happen during importing geospatial data into R is that the coordinate system of the source data was either missing (such as due to missing .proj for ESRI shapefile) or wrongly assigned during the importing process.\nThis is an example the coordinate system of mpsz simple feature data frame by using st_crs() of sf package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: SVY21 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21[WGS84]\",\n        DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",6326]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]],\n    CONVERSION[\"unnamed\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"(E)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]],\n        AXIS[\"(N)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]]]\n\n\nAlthough mpsz data frame is projected in svy21 but when we read until the end of the print, it indicates that the EPSG is 9001. This is a wrong EPSG code because the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.\nIn order to assign the correct EPSG code to mpsz data frame, st_set_crs() of sf package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nmpsz3414 <- st_set_crs(mpsz, 3414)\n\nWarning: st_crs<- : replacing crs does not reproject data; use st_transform for\nthat\n\n\nNow, let us check the CSR again by using the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz3414)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:3414 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21 / Singapore TM\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21\",\n        DATUM[\"SVY21\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4757]],\n    CONVERSION[\"Singapore Transverse Mercator\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"northing (N)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"easting (E)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Cadastre, engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"Singapore - onshore and offshore.\"],\n        BBOX[1.13,103.59,1.47,104.07]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",3414]]\n\n\nNotice that the EPSG code is 3414 now.\n\n\n\nIn geospatial analytics, it is very common for us to transform the original data from geographic coordinate system to projected coordinate system. This is because geographic coordinate system is not appropriate if the analysis need to use distance or/and area measurements.\nLet us take preschool simple feature data frame as an example. The print below reveals that it is in wgs84 coordinate system.\nThis is a scenario that st_set_crs() is not appropriate and st_transform() of sf package should be used. This is because we need to reproject preschool from one coordinate system to another coordinate system mathemetically.\nLet us perform the projection transformation by using the code chunk below.\n\npreschool3414 <- st_transform(preschool, \n                              crs = 3414)\n\n\nNote: In practice, we need find out the appropriate project coordinate system to use before performing the projection transformation.\n\nNext, let us display the content of preschool3414 sf data frame as shown below.\nNotice that it is in svy21 projected coordinate system now. Furthermore, if you refer to Bounding box:, the values are greater than 0-360 range of decimal degree commonly used by most of the geographic coordinate systems.\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, it is not unusual that we will come across data such as listing of Inside Airbnb. We call this kind of data aspatial data. This is because it is not a geospatial data but among the data fields, there are two fields that capture the x- and y-coordinates of the data points.\nIn this section, you will learn how to import an aspatial data into R environment and save it as a tibble data frame. Next, you will convert it into a simple feature data frame.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the listings.csv data downloaded from AirBnb will be used.\n\n\nSince listings data set is in csv file format, we will use read_csv() of readr package to import listing.csv as shown the code chunk below. The output R object is called listings and it is a tibble data frame.\n\nlistings <- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/listings.csv\")\n\nRows: 4252 Columns: 16\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (5): name, host_name, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room_type\ndbl  (10): id, host_id, latitude, longitude, price, minimum_nights, number_o...\ndate  (1): last_review\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe code chunk below shows list() of Base R instead of glimpse() is used to do the job.\n\nlist(listings) \n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 4,252 × 16\n       id name     host_id host_…¹ neigh…² neigh…³ latit…⁴ longi…⁵ room_…⁶ price\n    <dbl> <chr>      <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>\n 1  50646 Pleasan…  227796 Sujatha Centra… Bukit …    1.33    104.

Two useful fields we are going to use in the next phase are latitude and longitude. Note that they are in decimal degree format. As a best guess, we will assume that the data is in wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below converts listing data frame into a simple feature data frame by using st_as_sf() of sf packages\n\nlistings_sf <- st_as_sf(listings, \n                       coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n                       crs=4326) %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 3414)\n\nThings to learn from the arguments above:\n\ncoords argument requires you to provide the column name of the x-coordinates first then followed by the column name of the y-coordinates.\ncrs argument requires you to provide the coordinates system in epsg format. EPSG: 4326 is wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System and EPSG: 3414 is Singapore SVY21 Projected Coordinate System. You can search for other country’s epsg code by referring to epsg.io.\n%>% is used to nest st_transform() to transform the newly created simple feature data frame into svy21 projected coordinates system.\n\nLet us examine the content of this newly created simple feature data frame.\n\nglimpse(listings_sf)\n\nRows: 4,252\nColumns: 15\n$ id                             <dbl> 50646, 71609, 71896, 71903, 275343, 275…\n$ name                           <chr> \"Pleasant Room along Bukit Timah\", \"Ens…\n$ host_id                        <dbl> 227796, 367042, 367042, 367042, 1439258…\n$ host_name                      <chr> \"Sujatha\", \"Belinda\", \"Belinda\", \"Belin…\n$ neighbourhood_group            <chr> \"Central Region\", \"East Region\", \"East …\n$ neighbourhood                  <chr> \"Bukit Timah\", \"Tampines\", \"Tampines\", …\n$ room_type                      <chr> \"Private room\", \"Private room\", \"Privat…\n$ price                          <dbl> 80, 178, 81, 81, 52, 40, 72, 41, 49, 49…\n$ minimum_nights                 <dbl> 90, 90, 90, 90, 14, 14, 90, 8, 14, 14, …\n$ number_of_reviews              <dbl> 18, 20, 24, 48, 20, 13, 133, 105, 14, 1…\n$ last_review                    <date> 2014-07-08, 2019-12-28, 2014-12-10, 20…\n$ reviews_per_month              <dbl> 0.22, 0.28, 0.33, 0.67, 0.20, 0.16, 1.2…\n$ calculated_host_listings_count <dbl> 1, 4, 4, 4, 50, 50, 7, 1, 50, 50, 50, 4…\n$ availability_365               <dbl> 365, 365, 365, 365, 353, 364, 365, 90, …\n$ geometry                       <POINT [m]> POINT (22646.02 35167.9), POINT (…\n\n\nTable above shows the content of listing_sf. Notice that a new column called geometry has been added into the data frame. On the other hand, the longitude and latitude columns have been dropped from the data frame.\n\n\n\n\nBesides providing functions to handling (i.e. importing, exporting, assigning projection, transforming projection etc) geospatial data, sf package also offers a wide range of geoprocessing (also known as GIS analysis) functions.\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform two commonly used geoprocessing functions, namely buffering and point in polygon count.\n\n\nThe scenario:\nThe authority is planning to upgrade the exiting cycling path. To do so, they need to acquire 5 metres of reserved land on the both sides of the current cycling path. You are tasked to determine the extend of the land need to be acquired and their total area.\nThe solution:\nFirstly, st_buffer() of sf package is used to compute the 5-meter buffers around cycling paths\n\nbuffer_cycling <- st_buffer(cyclingpath, \n                               dist=5, nQuadSegs = 30)\n\nThis is followed by calculating the area of the buffers as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nbuffer_cycling$AREA <- st_area(buffer_cycling)\n\nLastly, sum() of Base R will be used to derive the total land involved\n\nsum(buffer_cycling$AREA)\n\n773143.9 [m^2]\n\n\nMission Accomplished!\n\n\n\nThe scenario:\nA pre-school service group want to find out the numbers of pre-schools in each Planning Subzone.\nThe solution:\nThe code chunk below performs two operations at one go. Firstly, identify pre-schools located inside each Planning Subzone by using st_intersects(). Next, length() of Base R is used to calculate numbers of pre-schools that fall inside each planning subzone.\n\nmpsz3414$`PreSch Count`<- lengths(st_intersects(mpsz3414, preschool3414))\n\n\nsummary(mpsz3414$`PreSch Count`)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

In this section, you will learn how to use appropriate ggplot2 functions to create functional and yet truthful statistical graphs for EDA purposes.\nFirstly, we will plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of PreSch Density. Conventionally, hist() of R Graphics will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nhist(mpsz3414$`PreSch Density`)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the syntax is very easy to use however the output is far from meeting publication quality. Furthermore, the function has limited room for further customisation.\nIn the code chunk below, appropriate ggplot2 functions will be used.\n\nggplot(data=mpsz3414, \n       aes(x= as.numeric(`PreSch Density`)))+\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Are pre-school even distributed in Singapore?\",\n       subtitle= \"There are many planning sub-zones with a single pre-school, on the other hand, \\nthere are two planning sub-zones with at least 20 pre-schools\",\n      x = \"Pre-school density (per km sq)\",\n      y = \"Frequency\")"
