    "text": "packages = c('sf','tidyverse')\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to handle geospatial data in R by using sf package.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you should acquire the following competencies:\n\ninstalling and loading sf and tidyverse packages into R environment,\nimporting geospatial data by using appropriate functions of sf package,\nimporting aspatial data by using appropriate function of readr package,\nexploring the content of simple feature data frame by using appropriate Base R and sf functions,\nassigning or transforming coordinate systems by using using appropriate sf functions,\nconverting an aspatial data into a sf data frame by using appropriate function of sf package,\nperforming geoprocessing tasks by using appropriate functions of sf package,\nperforming data wrangling tasks by using appropriate functions of dplyr package and\nperforming Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by using appropriate functions from ggplot2 package.\n\n\nNote: Students are encouraged to read the reference guide of each function, especially the input data requirements, syntaxt and argument option before using them.\n\n\n\n\nData are key to data analytics including geospatial analytics. Hence, before analysing, we need to assemble the necessary data. In this hands-on exercise, you are required to extract the necessary data sets from the following sources:\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from data.gov.sg\nPre-Schools Location from data.gov.sg\nCycling Path from LTADataMall\nLatest version of Singapore Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb\n\n\nNote: The purpose of this section is not merely extracting the necessary data sets. It also aims to introduce you to public available data sets. Students are encouraged to explore the rest of the available data sets in these three data sources.\n\n\n\nNext, at the Hands-on_Ex01 folder, create a sub-folder called data. Then, inside the data sub-folder, create two sub-folders and name them geospatial and aspatial respectively.\nPlace Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web), Pre-Schools Location and Cycling Path zipped files into geospatial sub-folder and unzipped them. Copy the unzipped files from their respective sub-folders and place them inside geospatial sub-folder.\n\n\n\nNow, you will extract the downloaded listing data file. At Downloads folder, cut and paste listing.csv into aspatial sub-folder.\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, two R packages will be used. They are:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data, and\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\n\nTidyverse consists of a family of R packages. In this hands-on exercise, the following packages will be used:\n\nreadr for importing csv data,\nreadxl for importing Excel worksheet,\ntidyr for manipulating data,\ndplyr for transforming data, and\nggplot2 for visualising data\n\nType the following code chunk.\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)\n\nWhat we can learn from the code chunk above:\n\np_load function pf pacman package is used to install and load sf and tidyverse pacages into R environment.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to import the following geospatial data into R by using st_read() of sf package:\n\nMP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format,\nCyclingPath, a line feature layer in ESRI shapefile format, and\nPreSchool, a point feature layer in kml file format.\n\n\n\n\nmpsz = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", layer = \"MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL\")\n\nReading layer `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL' from data source \n  `D:\\yuetongz\\ISSS624\\data\\geospatial' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 323 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nThe message above reveals that the geospatial objects are multipolygon features. There are a total of 323 multipolygon features and 15 fields in mpsz simple feature data frame. mpsz is in svy21 projected coordinates systems. The bounding box provides the x extend and y extend of the data.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() function of sf package to import CyclingPath shapefile into R as line feature data frame.\n\ncyclingpath = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", layer = \"CyclingPath\")\n\nReading layer `CyclingPath' from data source `D:\\yuetongz\\ISSS624\\data\\geospatial' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1625 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 12711.19 ymin: 28711.33 xmax: 42626.09 ymax: 48948.15\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nThe message above reveals that there are a total of 1625 features and 2 fields in cyclingpath linestring feature data frame and it is in svy21 projected coordinates system too.\n\n\n\nThe pre-schools-location-kml is in kml format. The code chunk below will be used to import the kml into R. Notice that in the code chunk below, the complete path and the kml file extension were provided.\n\npreschool = st_read(\"data/geospatial/pre-schools-location-kml.kml\")\n\nReading layer `PRESCHOOLS_LOCATION' from data source \n  `D:\\yuetongz\\ISSS624\\data\\geospatial\\pre-schools-location-kml.kml' \n  using driver `KML'\nSimple feature collection with 1359 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 103.6824 ymin: 1.248403 xmax: 103.9897 ymax: 1.462134\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nThe message above reveals that preschool is a point feature data frame. There are a total of 1359 features and 2 fields. Different from the previous two simple feature data frame, preschool is in wgs84 coordinates system.\n\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn different ways to retrieve information related to the content of a simple feature data frame.\n\n\nThe column in the sf data.frame that contains the geometries is a list, of class sfc. We can retrieve the geometry list-column in this case by mpsz$geom or mpsz[[1]], but the more general way uses st_geometry() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nst_geometry(mpsz)\n\nGeometry set for 323 features \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\nFirst 5 geometries:\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((31495.56 30140.01, 31980.96 296...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((29092.28 30021.89, 29119.64 300...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((29932.33 29879.12, 29947.32 298...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((27131.28 30059.73, 27088.33 297...\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((26451.03 30396.46, 26440.47 303...\n\n\nNotice that the print only displays basic information of the feature class such as type of geometry, the geographic extent of the features and the coordinate system of the data.\n\n\n\nBeside the basic feature information, we also would like to learn more about the associated attribute information in the data frame. This is the time you will find glimpse() of dplyr. very handy as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nglimpse(mpsz)\n\nRows: 323\nColumns: 16\n$ OBJECTID   <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, …\n$ SUBZONE_NO <int> 1, 1, 3, 8, 3, 7, 9, 2, 13, 7, 12, 6, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, …\n$ SUBZONE_N  <chr> \"MARINA SOUTH\", \"PEARL'S HILL\", \"BOAT QUAY\", \"HENDERSON HIL…\n$ SUBZONE_C  <chr> \"MSSZ01\", \"OTSZ01\", \"SRSZ03\", \"BMSZ08\", \"BMSZ03\", \"BMSZ07\",…\n$ CA_IND     <chr> \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"Y\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\", \"N\",…\n$ PLN_AREA_N <chr> \"MARINA SOUTH\", \"OUTRAM\", \"SINGAPORE RIVER\", \"BUKIT MERAH\",…\n$ PLN_AREA_C <chr> \"MS\", \"OT\", \"SR\", \"BM\", \"BM\", \"BM\", \"BM\", \"SR\", \"QT\", \"QT\",…\n$ REGION_N   <chr> \"CENTRAL REGION\", \"CENTRAL REGION\", \"CENTRAL REGION\", \"CENT…\n$ REGION_C   <chr> \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\", \"CR\",…\n$ INC_CRC    <chr> \"5ED7EB253F99252E\", \"8C7149B9EB32EEFC\", \"C35FEFF02B13E0E5\",…\n$ FMEL_UPD_D <date> 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05, 2014-12-05…\n$ X_ADDR     <dbl> 31595.84, 28679.06, 29654.96, 26782.83, 26201.96, 25358.82,…\n$ Y_ADDR     <dbl> 29220.19, 29782.05, 29974.66, 29933.77, 30005.70, 29991.38,…\n$ SHAPE_Leng <dbl> 5267.381, 3506.107, 1740.926, 3313.625, 2825.594, 4428.913,…\n$ SHAPE_Area <dbl> 1630379.27, 559816.25, 160807.50, 595428.89, 387429.44, 103…\n$ geometry   <MULTIPOLYGON [m]> MULTIPOLYGON (((31495.56 30..., MULTIPOLYGON (…\n\n\nglimpse() report reveals the data type of each fields.

We are also interested to visualise the geospatial features. This is the time you will find plot() of R Graphic comes in very handy as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(mpsz)\n\nWarning: plotting the first 9 out of 15 attributes; use max.plot = 15 to plot\nall\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default plot of an sf object is a multi-plot of all attributes, up to a reasonable maximum as shown above. We can, however, choose to plot only the geometry by using the code chunk below.\n\nplot(st_geometry(mpsz))\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can also choose the plot the sf object by using a specific attribute as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(mpsz[\"PLN_AREA_N\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap projection is an important property of a geospatial data. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, we need to ensure that both geospatial data are projected using similar coordinate system.\nIn this section, you will learn how to project a simple feature data frame from one coordinate system to another coordinate system. The technical term of this process is called projection transformation.\n\n\nOne of the common issue that can happen during importing geospatial data into R is that the coordinate system of the source data was either missing (such as due to missing .proj for ESRI shapefile) or wrongly assigned during the importing process.\nThis is an example the coordinate system of mpsz simple feature data frame by using st_crs() of sf package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: SVY21 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21[WGS84]\",\n        DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",6326]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]],\n    CONVERSION[\"unnamed\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"(E)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]],\n        AXIS[\"(N)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]]]\n\n\nAlthough mpsz data frame is projected in svy21 but when we read until the end of the print, it indicates that the EPSG is 9001. This is a wrong EPSG code because the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.\nIn order to assign the correct EPSG code to mpsz data frame, st_set_crs() of sf package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nmpsz3414 <- st_set_crs(mpsz, 3414)\n\nWarning: st_crs<- : replacing crs does not reproject data; use st_transform for\nthat\n\n\nNow, let us check the CSR again by using the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz3414)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:3414 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21 / Singapore TM\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21\",\n        DATUM[\"SVY21\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4757]],\n    CONVERSION[\"Singapore Transverse Mercator\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"northing (N)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"easting (E)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Cadastre, engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"Singapore - onshore and offshore.\"],\n        BBOX[1.13,103.59,1.47,104.07]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",3414]]\n\n\nNotice that the EPSG code is 3414 now.\n\n\n\nIn geospatial analytics, it is very common for us to transform the original data from geographic coordinate system to projected coordinate system. This is because geographic coordinate system is not appropriate if the analysis need to use distance or/and area measurements.\nLet us take preschool simple feature data frame as an example. The print below reveals that it is in wgs84 coordinate system.\nThis is a scenario that st_set_crs() is not appropriate and st_transform() of sf package should be used. This is because we need to reproject preschool from one coordinate system to another coordinate system mathemetically.\nLet us perform the projection transformation by using the code chunk below.\n\npreschool3414 <- st_transform(preschool, \n                              crs = 3414)\n\n\nNote: In practice, we need find out the appropriate project coordinate system to use before performing the projection transformation.\n\nNext, let us display the content of preschool3414 sf data frame as shown below.\nNotice that it is in svy21 projected coordinate system now. Furthermore, if you refer to Bounding box:, the values are greater than 0-360 range of decimal degree commonly used by most of the geographic coordinate systems.\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, it is not unusual that we will come across data such as listing of Inside Airbnb. We call this kind of data aspatial data. This is because it is not a geospatial data but among the data fields, there are two fields that capture the x- and y-coordinates of the data points.\nIn this section, you will learn how to import an aspatial data into R environment and save it as a tibble data frame. Next, you will convert it into a simple feature data frame.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the listings.csv data downloaded from AirBnb will be used.\n\n\nSince listings data set is in csv file format, we will use read_csv() of readr package to import listing.csv as shown the code chunk below. The output R object is called listings and it is a tibble data frame.\n\nlistings <- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/listings.csv\")\n\nRows: 4252 Columns: 16\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (5): name, host_name, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room_type\ndbl  (10): id, host_id, latitude, longitude, price, minimum_nights, number_o...\ndate  (1): last_review\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe code chunk below shows list() of Base R instead of glimpse() is used to do the job.\n\nlist(listings) \n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 4,252 × 16\n       id name     host_id host_…¹ neigh…² neigh…³ latit…⁴ longi…⁵ room_…⁶ price\n    <dbl> <chr>      <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>\n 1  50646 Pleasan…  227796 Sujatha Centra… Bukit …    1.33    104.

To do so, they need to acquire 5 metres of reserved land on the both sides of the current cycling path. You are tasked to determine the extend of the land need to be acquired and their total area.\nThe solution:\nFirstly, st_buffer() of sf package is used to compute the 5-meter buffers around cycling paths\n\nbuffer_cycling <- st_buffer(cyclingpath, \n                               dist=5, nQuadSegs = 30)\n\nThis is followed by calculating the area of the buffers as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nbuffer_cycling$AREA <- st_area(buffer_cycling)\n\nLastly, sum() of Base R will be used to derive the total land involved\n\nsum(buffer_cycling$AREA)\n\n773143.9 [m^2]\n\n\nMission Accomplished!\n\n\n\nThe scenario:\nA pre-school service group want to find out the numbers of pre-schools in each Planning Subzone.\nThe solution:\nThe code chunk below performs two operations at one go.

For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to plot functional and truthful choropleth maps by using an R package called **tmap** package.\n\n\nIt is advisable for you to read the functional description of each function before using them.\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the key R package use is tmap package in R. Beside tmap package, four other R packages will be used. They are:\n\nreadr for importing delimited text file,\ntidyr for tidying data,\ndplyr for wrangling data and\nsf for handling geospatial data.\n\nAmong the four packages, readr, tidyr and dplyr are part of tidyverse package.\nThe code chunk below will be used to install and load these packages in RStudio.\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)\n\nNotice that, we only need to install tidyverse instead of readr, tidyr and dplyr individually.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo data set will be used to create the choropleth map. They are:\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) (i.e. MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL) in ESRI shapefile format. It can be downloaded at data.gov.sg This is a geospatial data. It consists of the geographical boundary of Singapore at the planning subzone level. The data is based on URA Master Plan 2014.\nSingapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2011-2020 in csv format (i.e. respopagesextod2011to2020.csv). This is an aspatial data fie. It can be downloaded at Department of Statistics, Singapore Although it does not contain any coordinates values, but it's PA and SZ fields can be used as unique identifiers to geocode to MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile.\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses the st_read() function of sf package to import MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile into R as a simple feature data frame called mpsz.\n\nmpsz <- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n                layer = \"MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL\")\n\nReading layer `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL' from data source \n  `D:\\yuetongz\\ISSS624\\data\\geospatial' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 323 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nYou can examine the content of mpsz by using the code chunk below.\n\nmpsz\n\nSimple feature collection with 323 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\nFirst 10 features:\n   OBJECTID SUBZONE_NO       SUBZONE_N SUBZONE_C CA_IND      PLN_AREA_N\n1         1          1    MARINA SOUTH    MSSZ01      Y    MARINA SOUTH\n2         2          1    PEARL'S HILL    OTSZ01      Y          OUTRAM\n3         3          3       BOAT QUAY    SRSZ03      Y SINGAPORE RIVER\n4         4          8  HENDERSON HILL    BMSZ08      N     BUKIT MERAH\n5         5          3         REDHILL    BMSZ03      N     BUKIT MERAH\n6         6          7  ALEXANDRA HILL    BMSZ07      N     BUKIT MERAH\n7         7          9   BUKIT HO SWEE    BMSZ09      N     BUKIT MERAH\n8         8          2     CLARKE QUAY    SRSZ02      Y SINGAPORE RIVER\n9         9         13 PASIR PANJANG 1    QTSZ13      N      QUEENSTOWN\n10       10          7       QUEENSWAY    QTSZ07      N      QUEENSTOWN\n   PLN_AREA_C       REGION_N REGION_C          INC_CRC FMEL_UPD_D   X_ADDR\n1          MS CENTRAL REGION       CR 5ED7EB253F99252E 2014-12-05 31595.84\n2          OT CENTRAL REGION       CR 8C7149B9EB32EEFC 2014-12-05 28679.06\n3          SR CENTRAL REGION       CR C35FEFF02B13E0E5 2014-12-05 29654.96\n4          BM CENTRAL REGION       CR 3775D82C5DDBEFBD 2014-12-05 26782.83\n5          BM CENTRAL REGION       CR 85D9ABEF0A40678F 2014-12-05 26201.96\n6          BM CENTRAL REGION       CR 9D286521EF5E3B59 2014-12-05 25358.82\n7          BM CENTRAL REGION       CR 7839A8577144EFE2 2014-12-05 27680.06\n8          SR CENTRAL REGION       CR 48661DC0FBA09F7A 2014-12-05 29253.21\n9          QT CENTRAL REGION       CR 1F721290C421BFAB 2014-12-05 22077.34\n10         QT CENTRAL REGION       CR 3580D2AFFBEE914C 2014-12-05 24168.31\n     Y_ADDR SHAPE_Leng SHAPE_Area                       geometry\n1  29220.19   5267.381  1630379.3 MULTIPOLYGON (((31495.56 30...\n2  29782.05   3506.107   559816.2 MULTIPOLYGON (((29092.28 30...\n3  29974.66   1740.926   160807.5 MULTIPOLYGON (((29932.33 29...\n4  29933.77   3313.625   595428.9 MULTIPOLYGON (((27131.28 30...\n5  30005.70   2825.594   387429.4 MULTIPOLYGON (((26451.03 30...\n6  29991.38   4428.913  1030378.8 MULTIPOLYGON (((25899.7 297...\n7  30230.86   3275.312   551732.0 MULTIPOLYGON (((27746.95 30...\n8  30222.86   2208.619   290184.7 MULTIPOLYGON (((29351.26 29...\n9  29893.78   6571.323  1084792.3 MULTIPOLYGON (((20996.49 30...\n10 30104.18   3454.239   631644.3 MULTIPOLYGON (((24472.11 29...\n\n\nNotice that only the first ten records will be displayed.

The data table should include the variables PA, SZ, YOUNG, ECONOMY ACTIVE, AGED, TOTAL, DEPENDENCY.\n\nYOUNG: age group 0 to 4 until age groyup 20 to 24,\nECONOMY ACTIVE: age group 25-29 until age group 60-64,\nAGED: age group 65 and above,\nTOTAL: all age group, and\nDEPENDENCY: the ratio between young and aged against economy active group\n\n\n\nThe following data wrangling and transformation functions will be used:\n\npivot_wider() of tidyr package, and\nmutate(), filter(), group_by() and select() of dplyr package\n\n\npopdata2020 <- popdata %>%\n  filter(Time == 2020) %>%\n  group_by(PA, SZ, AG) %>%\n  summarise(`POP` = sum(`Pop`)) %>%\n  ungroup()%>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from=AG, \n              values_from=POP) %>%\n  mutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6])\n         +rowSums(.[12])) %>%\nmutate(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` = rowSums(.[7:11])+\nrowSums(.[13:15]))%>%\nmutate(`AGED`=rowSums(.[16:21])) %>%\nmutate(`TOTAL`=rowSums(.[3:21])) %>%  \nmutate(`DEPENDENCY` = (`YOUNG` + `AGED`)\n/`ECONOMY ACTIVE`) %>%\n  select(`PA`, `SZ`, `YOUNG`, \n       `ECONOMY ACTIVE`, `AGED`, \n       `TOTAL`, `DEPENDENCY`)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'PA', 'SZ'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can perform the georelational join, one extra step is required to convert the values in PA and SZ fields to uppercase. This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\npopdata2020 <- popdata2020 %>%\n  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ), \n          .funs = funs(toupper)) %>%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` > 0)\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\nmpsz_pop2020 <- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.\n\n\nwrite_rds(mpsz_pop2020, \"data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020, \n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ntmap_mode() with \"plot\" option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, \"view\" option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\n\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap's drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, we will share with you tmap functions that used to plot these elements.\n\n\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) + tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called \"pretty\". A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is \"solid\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 20,\n          style = \"equal\") + tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 10,\n          style = \"equal\") + tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 2,\n          style = \"equal\") + tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"equal\") + tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.0000  0.6519  0.7025  0.7742  0.7645 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Values have found that are higher than the highest break\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map is shaded in green.\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a \"-\" prefix.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\n\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\n\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"jenks\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using tmap_style().\nThe code chunk below shows the classic style is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\ntmap style set to \"classic\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside map style, tmap also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.\nIn the code chunk below, tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid() are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of persons\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_style(\"white\")\n\ntmap style set to \"white\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall multiple maps, also referred to as facet maps, are composed of many maps arrange side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.\nIn tmap, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the asthetic arguments,\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets(), and\nby creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ncols in tm_fill()\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\", \n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\ntmap style set to \"white\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(c(\"DEPENDENCY\",\"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\", \"quantile\"), \n          palette = list(\"Blues\",\"Greens\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using tm_facets().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0) + \n  tm_facets(by=\"REGION_N\", \n            free.coords=TRUE, \n            drop.shapes=TRUE) +\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\", \"center\"), \n            title.size = 20) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: The argument drop.shapes has been renamed to drop.units, and is\ntherefore deprecated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\nyoungmap <- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap <- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, you can also use selection funtion to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning in pre_process_gt(x, interactive = interactive, orig_crs =\ngm$shape.orig_crs): legend.width controls the width of the legend within a map.\nPlease use legend.outside.size to control the width of the outside legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap: Thematic Maps in R\ntmap\ntmap: get started!\ntmap: changes in version 2.0\ntmap: creating thematic maps in a flexible way (useR!2015)\nExploring and presenting maps with tmap (useR!2017)\n\n\n\n\n\nsf: Simple Features for R\nSimple Features for R: StandardizedSupport for Spatial Vector Data\nReading, Writing and Converting Simple Features\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\nTidy data\ntidyr: Easily Tidy Data with 'spread()' and 'gather()' Functions"
